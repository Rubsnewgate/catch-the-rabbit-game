1- Use properties that only need to go through the Composite process whenever
possible.

2- If you need to animate a property that is very expensive (such as width,
height, left, among others), try to find another property that is less costly
with which you can achieve the same result (or at least a similar result).

3- Avoid animating many properties simultaneously.

4- If you need to hide elements, normally use the opacity and visibility
properties instead of using the display property (as it's a not animatable
property: Properties that can be animated).

5- Avoid creating animations triggered by scrolling, as the scroll event
listener is executed a large number of times. It's better to wait until
you reach a certain point on the screen and then trigger the animation.
